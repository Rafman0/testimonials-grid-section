## My process

I started with the mobile-Approach first, and worked my way into the desktop view, so as to make the layout for mobile phones look very nice.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- Smacks
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Well i learnt how to use grid to make proper layout to the webpage, and i also learnt that css flexbox, doesn't properly arranges the items in a webpage. CSS Grid is more 2D focused, and is what is used for this challenge.


### Continued development

Unfortunately i wasn't able to fully recreate the layout used in this challenge, and i would really like to focuse more on how to properly use grid, and make proper layouts.

### Useful resources

ChatGPT gave me an idea that i have to use grid instead of flexbox, and also explained how to use the grid-template-rows.
